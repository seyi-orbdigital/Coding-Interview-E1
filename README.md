# üß™ JavaScript Coding Challenge: Unique Words Counter

## Overview

This is a simple JavaScript coding challenge designed to assess your ability to work with strings, arrays, and basic logic. Your task is to implement a function that counts the number of **unique words** in a given string of text.

---

## üìù Task

Write a JavaScript function named `countUniqueWords` that takes a string as input and returns the number of unique words in it.

### üîß Function Signature

```javascript
function countUniqueWords(text) {
  // Your implementation here
}
```

# ‚úÖ Requirements
  - The comparison must be case-insensitive.

  - All punctuation should be ignored (e.g., commas, periods, exclamation marks, etc.).

  - Only plain JavaScript is allowed (no external libraries like Lodash or jQuery).

## Example

```javascript
countUniqueWords("Hello, hello! How are you?"); // Output: 4
// Unique words: "hello", "how", "are", "you"

countUniqueWords("One fish, two fish. Red fish, blue fish."); // Output: 5
// Unique words: "one", "fish", "two", "red", "blue"
```
